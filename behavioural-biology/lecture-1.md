# Behavioral biology - Lecture one

## notes

- things control each other
  - mental state controls body
  - body controls behavior
  - for example: things responsible for murder:
    - tumor
    - period
    - junk food
    - steroids

- categorical thinking becomes problems
  - for example: why did the chicken cross the road?
    - hormone levels
    - environmental stimulus
    - genetic triggers
    - evolutionary gene propagation

- Wellesley effect
  - cycle synchronization
  - most socially outgoing one is usually dominant

## strategy

- what does behavior look like
- what happened before? (neurons)
- sensory stimuli to trigger neurons
- evolutionary pressure

## books

- Bob Sapolski: Behave
- James Gleick: Chaos
  - behavior can't be understood by reductio
