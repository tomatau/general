## Relationships

**Objective definition**:

- We use measurements for "objective" reality (1)
- Measurements are relative (2)

**Things**

- We can describe life by: "entities" having "movements" (3)
- Assume there are consistent scales to measure "entities"
- Assume there are consistent scales to measure "movements"

**Ought**

- Ought is for: actions of entities or "goals" or "the good"
- Good/goal exists in the relationships between entities
- Actions are also relative
- Goals describe a "relative good" for en entity (4)

**Therefore**

- Goals can be measured by relative movements between entities
- Moral actions can be measured
- Moral actions can be objective when considered in relative terms
