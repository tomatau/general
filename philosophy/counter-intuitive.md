## Counter intuitive possibilities

- Logical paradoxes e.g. `P and not P`
- Infinite quantities
- An infinite plane
- There must exist something that has no cause
- Something that exists without relation to other entities
  - If you keep zooming in on a particle, it's surrounded by empty
  - Need the empty space to be an infinite plane
