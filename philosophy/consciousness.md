## argument for infants being self aware

- 1. I'm self aware
-
- 2. My brain seems like the source of my "self awareness"
-
- 3. My brain has a macro-structure of
  - lobes,
  - amygdala, etc...
  - related to self:
    - insular cortex
    - the anterior cingulate cortex,
    - medial prefrontal cortex
      - guilt, compassion, or embarrassment
      - collective view of self
-
- 4. self awareness is a comparative advantage in natural selection
  - because it can be associated with goals and survival
  - there would be a tendency for it to proliferate
-
- 5. i try to survive
-
- 6. other humans are self aware
-
- 7. other humans try to survive
-
- 8. infants try to survive

## what makes something self aware?

- My brain can:
  - process sensory data <---
  - learn and recognize patterns <---
    - store memories temporarily or make those memories more long lasting
  - self reflect and correct
  - seek goals (e.g. survival) <---
  - embodiment <---

## does self awareness arise epigenetically?

- what else changes in the brain other than neurons making new connections?
- the overall process' don't seem to change,
  - people don't seem to suddenly learn a new sense such as sight/smell/heat detection
  - does sense of self seems even more complex than other senses??
  - babies start learning straight away
- the survival process' such as embodied movement towards goals seems to be an indicator of some sense of self
