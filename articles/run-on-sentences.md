# Run on sentences

https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-are-run-on-sentences

## Skim

- lacks punctuation
- fused sentences


## How to fix

- depends on how the parts of a sentence relate
- also depends on the tone and rhythm

**full stop**

- completely separate

**semicolon**

- keeps more of a connection

**conjunction with a comma**

- makes it more like a comment on the connection
- e.g. `this, and that`, `this, yet that`, or `this, but that`

**conjunctive adverb with a semicolon and a comma**

- e.g. `this; nevertheless, that`

## Summary of fixing

- If the first clause introduces the second clause, you can use a colon.
- Run on sentence is when you fuse two complete sentences together without punctuation.

## Writing style

- no right answer for how to connect clauses in most cases
- you determine the tone you want to set
- full stop has hard tone
- conjunctive adverb with a semicolon and comma is more conversational
