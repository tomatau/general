## Writing Great Docs

https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/#writing-great-documentation

## Documentation should be:

### Precursory

- do it before writing the code
  - requirements
  - specifications
- lay a clear path going forwards
- helps facilitate feedback to group decisions
- same sentiment as TDD

# ADEPT method

e.g. imaginary numbers

## A for Analogy

- use what we already know
  - analogies are like a raft we use to cross the river of understanding
  - we ditch them when we get there
- e.g. + and - go left and right, imaginary go around the number line

## D for Diagram

- half brain for visual processing

## E for Example

- experience the idea
- don't use terminology
  - "Here's what some smart person figured out, now memorize!"
  - "here's what i had for dinner"
- e.g. what happens after a few turns around the line

## P for Plain English

- use your own words

## T for Technical Description

- formalities (formal notation)
- e.g. sheet music for the song
- get mathy or processy

# Modify Learning Order

- Baseline vs Progressive
  - increase the quality of an overall idea rather thant top down
- sometimes need to untangle concepts when writing
  - work backwards:
    - explain details in own words
    - solve an example
    - make a diagram
    - relate concept to analogy

# Bonus: BE Adept

## BE (Brevity and Empathy)

- brevity is beautiful
- relate common experience
- anticipate questions
