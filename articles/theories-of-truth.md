# Theories of truth

## Correspondence

- most intuitive one

### Basic fact theory

- x is true iff it corresponds to a fact
- vice versa
- implies
  - anything that doesn't bear truth is "false" because it doesn't correspond to a fact. E.g. a pencil is false
  - everything is either true or false

### State of affairs theory

- x is true if it corresponds to a "state of affairs that obtains"
- vice versa "does not obtain"
- implies
  - needs both state of affairs and "to obtain"
  - pencil is state of affairs, but doesn't obtain

- similar to fact theory of truth
- difference with negation and false

### Meinongian fact theory

- x is true iff it corresponds to a fact that exists
- x is false iff it corresponds to a fact that doesn't exist
- _not sure of the problem about things not existing but being true_

### Mis-correspondence fact theory

- x is true iff it corresponds to some fact
- x is false iff it mis-corresponds to some fact

### Objections

- frege
  - claims either:
    - correspondence between maker and bearer is perfect + complete
    - maker and bearer are distinct, 1 is idea and other is reality
  - first muddles the word correspondence
    - idea "is" reality, doesn't correspond to it
  - second makes perfect correspondence impossible

## Identity theory of truth

- maker and bearer are same thing
- use propositions or judgement as truth-maker, not sentences

### Primitivism

- judgement is truth-maker

## Coherence theory of truth

- truth-bearers cohere with truth-bearers
- truth-makers are truth-bearers
- spiders web made of truth-bearers that must cohere
- two roads:
  - metaphysical (idealism)
  - epistemic (justification coherentism)

## Pragmatism theory of truth

- William James
- meaning behind concept and how to choose what meaning
- take concept which makes most sense in a context

## Deflationary theory of truth

- truth is more simple than (inflationary theories)
- no deeper nature of truth beyond what can be understood from everyday claims
  - the talk about truth over complex
- truth predicates don't change the statement
- examples:
  - disquotational theory of truth
  - redundancy theory of truth
  - minimalist theory of truth
  - disappearance theory of truth
  - no-truth theory of truth
