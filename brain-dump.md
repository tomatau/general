## Counter intuitive possibilities

- Logical paradoxes e.g. `P and not P`
- Infinite quantities
- An infinite plane
- There must exist something that has no cause
- Something that exists without relation to other entities
  - If you keep zooming in on a particle, it's surrounded by empty
  - Need the empty space to be an infinite plane

## Relationships

**Objective definition**:

- We use measurements for "objective" reality (1)
- Measurements are relative (2)

**Things**

- We can describe life by: "entities" having "movements" (3)
- Assume there are consistent scales to measure "entities"
- Assume there are consistent scales to measure "movements"

**Ought**

- Ought is for: actions of entities or "goals" or "the good"
- Good/goal exists in the relationships between entities
- Actions are also relative
- Goals describe a "relative good" for en entity (4)

**Therefore**

- Goals can be measured by relative movements between entities
- Moral actions can be measured
- Moral actions can be objective when considered in relative terms

## To do good

- I think permaculture is important

What systems and structures are needed:
- local systems of sustenance (food)
  - trees, veggies, grains, nuts, legumes,
- harmonious process of waste and growth (food and products)
- specialized skills for advanced stuff
  - airplanes
  - mobile phones, laptops?
  - creating the parts requires rare earths
  - assembly might be able to take place locally

What do we already have?
- specialized skills, factories,
- transport systems
- comparative advantage, so benefit from trade
- lots of products
- lots of waste
- terrible capital/resource/opportunity distribution

What's fucked?
- waste is damaging to ecosystems
- production is damaging to ecosystems
- inefficient use of energy by people (e.g. products flying around the planet)

Steps to get the systems and structures:
- make economies more self sustaining and less depending on trade
