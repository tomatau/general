## Thiesm

- the universe is grounded in a singularity
  - within the universe, entities are connected like a web
  - a web is a relativistic, we see this in special relativity (time/space/energy)

- relativity can't be escaped
  -

- human evolution has tended for "fitness" against reality
  - we percieve "causality", this is not necessarily an absolute
  - causality is a relative property of existance

- the signularity is either unique or one of multiple, or both...
  - if only one, it is the ultimate creator (how did it come about?)
  - if multiple, it is relative to others (what caused them?)
  - if both one and multiple, it exists in a plane that can operate outside of logic
    - if laws of logic are escapable, an entity can be circular

> is the universe eternal?

no, it was born and it will die

> where does logic come from?

constraints of human perception

> where do the constraints come from?

the singularity

> where does the singularity come from?

it wasn't caused, causality isn't absolute, it's relative

> how do we know reality?

we don't, we get "close enough" to survive

> what is the ultimate cause?

- there isn't one, causality isn't absolute, it's relative
- there can't be a singular thing, any identity needs to be in contrast to not that identity, so there must be at least 2 things, then we have circularity

> if god is an origin point for all things, what necessitates it is a "he", it has "emotion", it has a "mind"?

> why would god have emotion if he predates existence?

> if god is all knowing/omnipotant/omnipresent, why does our belief in god have any effect on god? why does god prefer we believe in god? can i upset god? do I have power over god? if I have power over god, how can god be omnipotant.

> does god have identity?

> how can you determine the identity, if there's nothing else to contrast with?

> if god created causality and logic, this must imply that causality and logic are not present in the plane of god. If we're in the plane of god, causality and logic aren't absolute. If causality isn't absolute, our universe doesn't need a cause.
