# Organic

## Environment

**Synthetic damages soils and ecosystems**

  - input of fertilizer and energy was reduced by 34 to 53%
  - input of pesticide reduced by 97%
  - Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.
  - more spiders, stephylinids, earthworms, carabids

**Organic is more efficient**

- input down by 53% and output down by 20%
  - 1.7 input for output
  - Enhanced soil fertility and higher biodiversity found in organic plots may render these systems less dependent on external inputs.
  - The study also conclusively demonstrates that for most crops, organic plots are more energy efficient per unit crop.

**Human health**

- Organic has more nutrition content
  - more magnesium and calcium
- animal by products heavily used in medicine... demand for medicine increases when we're less healthy

**Utilise by products helps prevent environmental harm**

- Unused meat products cause serious environmental pollution.
- most nitrogen enters human water supply and does not go into plants
  - due to run off of poor soils

- lots of footsoldier's things

**Synthetic increases need for bad pest control practices**

- Organic agriculture promotes evenness and natural pest control
  - more evenness between natural enemies
  - deter pests rather than poach or poison them

https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2006.3530

- in 74% and 45% of the studies reviewed, respectively, natural enemy populations were higher and pest pressure lower in complex landscapes versus simple landscapes

- Organic yield is more than sufficient

**more animals die in conventional**

  - animals die from loss of crop cover (organic mixed crops retain cover)
  - pesticides killing animals
  - harvesters and more heavy machinery, ploughs and tractors used more in large scale monocultures

**Cancer**

- Organic crops contained significantly more vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus and significantly less nitrates than conventional crops.

- Studies have shown increased risks of colon, kidney, and stomach cancer among people with higher ingestion of water nitrate
- Other studies have shown modest evidence that higher nitrate intake can increase the risk of thyroid cancer and ovarian cancer among women.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383574218300887

- confirms link between glyphosate being carcinogenic
- which indicates a statistically significant increased risk (41%) of NHL following high cumulative GBH exposure

**soil erosion in conventional**

  - a rate of more than 10 million hectares per year
  - HUGE PROBLEM, need organic methods to replenish if at all... still a consensus you can't replenish despite studies proving organic/permaculture methods have shown promise.

https://www.nature.com/articles/330370a0

- This study indicates that, in the long term, the organic farming system was more effective than the conventional farming system in reducing soil erosion and, therefore, in maintaining soil productivity.

- Model estimates indicate that organic methods could produce enough food on a global per capita basis to sustain the current human population, and potentially an even larger population, without increasing the agricultural land base

## Other arguments

- Aiming for better:
  - Increased demand for organic would allow for organic farms to support each other instead of trade with meat industry
  - Decreased demand for meat would mean more animal sancturies could supply fertiliser
- Would lack of demand for organic even work?
  - What's to say the meat industry wouldn't be susidised in their disposal of by products as actual meat demend isn't changed by vegan organic/non-organic choices.
- Are the synthetic fertilisers even 100% synthetic?...
- research is being done to use manures in the production of synthetic fertilisers...
- **TOXICITY** Nitrogen- and phosphate-based synthetic fertilizers leach into groundwater and increase its toxicity, causing water pollution.
- **FACTORIES** - synthetic fertilisers are produced via methods that are harmful to the environment.
  - made from by products of petroleum industry
    - peak oil...
    - harmful to environment and animals...
  - nitrogen : burning natural gas, lots of ammonia which can greatly harm water bodies. Many catalysts used, don't know their sources... ammonia mostly from china. depends on infrastructure and god knows how many food miles it increases...
  - phosphorous : from rock with sulfuric acid. multiple reactions with ammonia etc.. can be made from animal bone and fuel...
  - Potassium :
